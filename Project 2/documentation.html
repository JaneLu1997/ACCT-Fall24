            <p>
                My word for this project is "densifying". I thought of plants being over-populated, which is what happened in the late Devonian extinction, resulting in the decrees of levels of oxygen in seas got some of the marine life killed. For this project specifically, I want to simulate the plants over-growth scenario.

            <h2> EXPERIMENTS & REFERENCE</h2>
            <p>
                Originally, I was thinking of making this simulation inside of Unity, on top to map out the influenc elements such as rain. However, Unity has its own limitation of modeling something that grow randomly or simulate that growth from bottom up. The only way I can figure out is to scale things up and down to simulate that growth. after some research, I turned to blender to get a more realistic densifying and growth effect. I found a Youtube tutorial on how to simulate that growth by instancing in blender, and will walk through on how I modify the nodes to meet the project's subject.

            <p>
                first thing off, I found a 3D model that works with my brief on PolyHaven, then to figure out the shader of the model inside of blender as shown below.

            <h2> GEOMETRY NODES SETUP</h2>
            <p>
                I first set up the instancing on the flower to determine its movement, to give it the scale up and down, plus the wiggling to make it look like a fast-forward mode of growing effect on each of them. As the first image suggested.
                <br>
                Second, I found a rock 3D model, then to take the surface nodes and instance the flowers on top of it. This act will hide the original rock model, however that is now what we want. So we'd need a specific setting to turn its visibility back on.

            <h2> EMPTY & VARIABLES</h2>
            <p>
                Now we have the flowers distributing among the surface, we need to change their growing pattern based on an interactive outside force. I create an empty in blender and then put it as an information inside of the rock's nodes.
                <br>
                The flower growth at this point looks more like from small to big. However, this is a bit different from what we want it to do: densifying. So instead of changing the scale of the object, we need to modify the density of the object instancing based on the relative position of the empty to the rock. I modified the elements inside of the nodes shown as below:
                <br>
                Finally, to prop up the scene and to make it make more sense, I switched out the rock to a beach model, then to place it among a water-looking skybox. Then to set up two different camera angle for this. Voila.
